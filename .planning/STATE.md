# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-17)

**Core value:** Users can reliably import media, edit segments on a familiar Jianying-style timeline, preview the result, save the draft, and export a video through one consistent editing and rendering model.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation And Golden Harness

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Foundation And Golden Harness) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 9
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-16 -- Phase 1 execution started

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 22%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 10 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 10 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 10 min
- Trend: baseline established

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Product is a general Jianying-style desktop video editor, not an oral-video product.
- Initialization: Rust core starts from day one; Electron is the first shell.
- Initialization: Jianying terminology should be used consistently across UI, Rust core, IPC, schema, docs, and tests.
- Initialization: Kdenlive/MLT/pyJianYingDraft are references only, not production runtimes.
- Initialization: Each phase needs executable test gates.
- Phase 01 Plan 01: Pinned root Rust/Node/pnpm toolchains and established `just` as the public command surface for Phase 1.
- [Phase 01]: Replaced the temporary workspace anchor with the first real Phase 1 semantic crate members. — Plan 01-02 moved the Rust workspace from a temporary anchor to real pure semantic crates so later bindings and service boundaries have stable package targets.
- [Phase 01]: Kept Phase 1 command scope to ping/version envelopes and standardized unsupported-command errors. — Real timeline editing commands are intentionally deferred; this protects the Phase 1 boundary from premature command semantics.
- [Phase 01]: Used generic CommandResultEnvelope<T> so typed ping/version responses can travel through the same ok/error/events result shape. — The generic result keeps typed Rust data while preserving the standardized envelope required by the Electron binding contract.
