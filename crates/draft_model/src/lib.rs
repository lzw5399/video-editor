//! Rust-owned draft and command contract model.
//!
//! This crate is the pure semantic source of truth for Jianying-aligned editor
//! concepts. Later plans add draft, material, track, segment, timerange,
//! keyframe, filter, and transition schema here before any Electron binding or
//! runtime service consumes them.

/// Current version label for the draft model contract surface.
